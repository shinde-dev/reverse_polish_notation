# ReversePolishNotation
A gem which provides rake task to perform arithmetic operations using reverse polish notation. It supports command line input / output at the moment but provides flexibility to add other sources in future. It is developed under the guidelines provided [here](https://gist.github.com/joedean/078a62b9ec03b38dfc519b3a5f168b07)

## Usage

bin/setup
```
This will install the bundler and then it will install all the dependencies.

## Rpn Calculator command:
    rake calculate_by_rpn:cli

## Run tests

## Future Enhancements

-  We can add another sources for input / output under `lib/reverse_polish_notation/providers`
